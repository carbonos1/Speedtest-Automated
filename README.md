# SpeedTest-Automated

Script + Libraries used to run both SpeedTest + iPerf tests in bulk, record the output, then Graph the results. Really is just a fancy wrapper to automate a lot of the tests I do en masse for work.

once the CLI Portion of the tool is complete, hopefully we can work towards building out a Django / Flask app so we can get a WEB GUI / (Electron GUI Maybe?)

## To-Do

### Priority 1:
- Refactor Existing Code to new Format - DONE
- Split out into Libraries - DONE
- Make the Tests more generic for use for general people.
- Port Graphs to something a bit more dynamic + User Friendly.

### Priority 2 / Optional:
- Build out Web App for use for stuff
- Dynamic Graphing??
